        <p>
            Huawei's P30 Pro is the first phone to feature a 5X optical zoom capability, thanks to a cleverly engineered periscopic lens system that uses a prism to direct light through the required optics without making this phone unreasonably thick. In terms of camera features and capabilities, the P30 Pro is a compelling alternative to heavyweights from Apple, Samsung and Google. That isn't this phone's only appeal either - it has a total of four rear cameras including a Time-of-Flight 3D depth sensor and an ultra-wide-angle camera. It also boasts of incredible low-light capabilities through the primary camera.
        </p>

            The P30 Pro uses Huawei's top-of-the-line Kirin 980 SoC. In India, it's sold with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, and there are no variants. There are two colour options, both of which are attention-grabbing and feature bright swirly gradients. You get a 4200mAh battery, 6.47-inch full-HD+ OLED screen, and an IP68 certification for ruggedness.
